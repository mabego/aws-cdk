# Fargate Service with ALB and Aurora

The code for my article [_Deploying and Destroying Infrastructure with AWS CDK and Route 53 Hosted
Zones_](https://periodical.pages.dev/posts/deploying-and-destroying-with-aws-cdk/).

This repository deploys a web app to ECS on AWS Fargate with an Aurora database using AWS CDK.

Update `rootDomain` and `subDomain` in cdk.json to deploy with your custom domain.
